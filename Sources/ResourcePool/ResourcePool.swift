// MARK: - Resource Pool

/// A thread-safe, actor-based resource pool with fair FIFO waiter queue
///
/// This implementation eliminates the thundering herd problem by using a FIFO
/// queue of continuations. When a resource becomes available, only the first
/// waiter in the queue is resumed - not all waiters.
///
/// # Features
/// - Lazy resource creation up to configured capacity
/// - Optional background warmup to pre-create resources (non-blocking)
/// - Automatic validation and reset on return
/// - Timeout support for acquisition
/// - Fair FIFO ordering prevents starvation
/// - Cancellation-safe resource usage via `withResource()`
/// - No thundering herd - O(1) waiter wakeup
/// - Production metrics tracking
///
/// # Important Notes
/// - Resources MUST be reference types (classes/actors)
/// - Always use `withResource()` for resource access
/// - Resources are validated and reset after each use
/// - Failed resources are discarded and lazily recreated
/// - Scales efficiently to 200+ concurrent waiters
///
/// # Basic Usage
/// ```swift
/// let pool = try await ResourcePool<MyResource>(
///     capacity: 10,
///     resourceConfig: .default,
///     warmup: true
/// )
///
/// let result = try await pool.withResource(timeout: .seconds(10)) { resource in
///     try await resource.performWork()
/// }
/// // Resource automatically returned, even if cancelled
/// ```
///
/// # Sharing Pools Across Your Application
///
/// **IMPORTANT:** For system-limited resources (WebViews, database connections, file handles),
/// creating multiple pool instances can lead to resource exhaustion. Instead, use a single
/// shared pool via a global actor:
///
/// ```swift
/// // Define a global actor to hold your shared pool
/// @globalActor
/// public actor MyResourcePoolActor {
///     public static let shared = MyResourcePoolActor()
///
///     private var sharedPool: ResourcePool<MyResource>?
///
///     public func getPool() async throws -> ResourcePool<MyResource> {
///         if let existing = sharedPool {
///             return existing
///         }
///
///         let pool = try await ResourcePool<MyResource>(
///             capacity: 10,
///             resourceConfig: .default,
///             warmup: true
///         )
///         sharedPool = pool
///         return pool
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Usage: All callers share the same pool
/// let pool = try await MyResourcePoolActor.shared.getPool()
/// try await pool.withResource { resource in
///     // Work with resource
/// }
/// ```
///
/// **Why share pools?**
/// - Prevents resource exhaustion (e.g., 7 parallel operations × 8 WebViews each = 56 WebViews)
/// - One warmup cost amortized across all users
/// - Better resource utilization through shared queuing
/// - System limits respected (macOS limits concurrent WebKit processes, DB connections, etc.)
///
/// **When NOT to share:**
/// - Different resource configurations needed
/// - Isolated testing scenarios
/// - Short-lived, bounded workloads
/// - Resources with incompatible lifecycles
